Exercise 7: Financial Forecasting

1. Understanding Recursive Algorithms

Concept of Recursion:
- Definition: Recursion is a technique in programming where a function calls itself in order to solve smaller instances of the same problem. This can simplify complex problems by breaking them down into simpler sub-problems.
- Base Case: A recursive function must have a base case to terminate the recursion. This is the simplest instance of the problem that can be solved directly.
- Recursive Case: The part of the function that reduces the problem into smaller sub-problems and calls itself.

Advantages:
- Simplifies the problem-solving process by dividing the problem into similar sub-problems.
- Can be more intuitive for problems that have a natural recursive structure.

Disadvantages:
- May lead to excessive computation and stack overflow if not managed properly.
- Often less efficient than iterative solutions for certain problems due to overhead from function calls.

2. Setup

We'll create a method to forecast future values using a recursive approach. The future value is predicted based on an initial value and a growth rate over a number of periods.

Future Value Calculation:
The future value \( F(n) \) can be recursively defined as:

\[ F(n) = F(n-1) \times (1 + \text{growthRate}) \]

where \( F(n-1) \) is the future value at period \( n-1 \) and `growthRate` is the rate of growth per period.


4. Analysis

Time Complexity:
- Recursive Approach: The time complexity of the recursive solution is \( O(n) \), where \( n \) is the number of periods. This is because the function makes \( n \) recursive calls, each reducing the number of periods by 1.

Optimization:
- Memoization: To avoid excessive computation, you can use memoization to store intermediate results and avoid redundant calculations. This technique is particularly useful when the function is called with overlapping sub-problems.
- Iterative Approach: For large numbers of periods, an iterative approach may be more efficient as it avoids the overhead of recursive function calls and stack space.
